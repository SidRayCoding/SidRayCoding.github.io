    <h1> French Open </h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
    <p> French tennis has been thriving the past few decades. What, with the likes of Jo-Wilfred Tsonga tearing up the international circuit and Richard Gasquet, not only ripping up the court but also ripping up his racket (haha) tennis is really thriving in France. The most important clay tournament also takes place in France, where the French Open has been an influential part in people's lives, and definitely tennis.</p>
    
    <h2> History </h2>
    
    <p> In 1925, the French Open became open to all amateurs internationally and was designated a major championship by the International Lawn Tennis Federation. It was held at the Stade Fran√ßais in Saint-Cloud (site of the previous World Hard Court Championships) in 1925 and 1927, on clay courts. In 1926 the Croix-Catelan of the Racing Club de France hosted the event in Paris, site of the previous French club members only tournament, also on clay. </p>
    
    <h2> Current Champions </h2> 
    
    <p> The French Open was crazy this year, with Spanish mastermind and the winner of the most French Opens in history, Rafa Nadal, getting knocked out in the semi-finals by none other than our good friend Novak Djokovic. The final was eventful, with Djokovic beating Greek no. 3 Stefanos Tsistipas in the final to win his 2nd Grand Slam of the year. </p>
    
    <h2> Time? </h2>
