    <h1> Australian Open </h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2> 
    
    <p> Regarded as the "Jewel of Australian Tennis" by avid tennis fans, most people were skeptical of the Australian Open at its inaugration to the Grand Slams in 1969, and there was a lot of backlash regarding the decision for it to become a mainstay at the highest level of tennis. Australia is not known for its tennis talent, so the idea of corruption was thrown around a lot back at that time. Nevertheless, the Australian Open has become one of the most premium hard-court tournaments in tennis history, with high-ranking players competing to win a coveted Grand Slam title.
