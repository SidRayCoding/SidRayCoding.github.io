    <h1> Wimbledon Championships </h1>
    
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    
    <p> Widely regarded the most important tournament in tennis, Wimbledon has had an amazing history. The only Grand Slam to be played on the court surface of grass, Wimbledon forces players to play a fast-paced, action packed game of tennis. Viewers have a lot of fun watching this tournament, and players feel more accomplished when finishing a match compared to other tournaments. Wimbledon is held in Wimbledon, London. </p>
    
    <h2> History </h2>
    
    <p> The inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championship started on 9 July 1877 and the Gentlemen's Singles was the only event held. 22 men paid a guinea (quarter of an ounce of gold) to enter the tournament, which was to be held over five days. The rain delayed it four more days and thus, on 19 July 1877, the final was played. Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player, defeated William Marshall 6–1, 6-2 and 6–4 in 48 minutes. Gore was presented with the silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas and donated by the sports magazine The Field, as well as a prize money of 12 guineas. About 200 spectators paid one shilling each to watch the final.</p>
    
    <h2> Current Champions </h2>
    
    <p> Novak Djokovic, our old friend, once again wins this tournament. He beats then no. 9 Matteo Berretini of Italy on Center Court to win his third Grand Slam title of the year, the most of any player in history within a calendar year since the Open Era began. </p>
    
    <h2> Time? </h2>

    <p> If you want to watch Wimbledon, you should tune in on TV or watch it live in London in July. </p>
