    <h1> US Open </h1>

    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p> The US Open has become the premier hard court event that has taken the world by storm. The US Open is held in New York City, New York, and is inspiration to millions of wannabe tennis professionals in the world. The US Open has been commended by multiple professionals as having the best tennis atmosphere, and the US, with it's rich tennis history, is the ideal place for the last Grand Slam of the year to take place. </p>

    <h2> History </h2>

    <p> The tournament was first held in August 1881 on grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island. That year, only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) were permitted to enter. Richard Sears won the men's singles at this tournament, which was the first of his seven consecutive singles titles.</p>

      <p>From 1884 through 1911, the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year's final, where he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament.</p>

      <p>In the first years of the US National Championship, only men competed and the tournament was known as the US National Singles Championships for Men. In September 1887, six years after the men's nationals were first held, the first US Women's National Singles Championship was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. The winner was 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell. In that same year, the men's doubles event was played at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, New Jersey.</p>

    <h2> Current Champions </h2>
    
    <p>Working his hardest to complete the first calendar Grand Slam of the open era, (winning all grand slams in one year) Novak Djokovic advances to the final without dropping a single set. This time, though, it was not to be, as no. 2 Daniil Medvedev, who Djokovic beat in the Australian Open final that same year, wins the tournament beating Novak in straight sets. It was a heartbreaking loss, but a bittersweet win for Medvedev, who apologised to Djokovic after the match.</p>

    <h2> Time? </h2>

    <p> If you want to watch the US Open, you should tune in on TV or watch it live in NYC in September. </p>
